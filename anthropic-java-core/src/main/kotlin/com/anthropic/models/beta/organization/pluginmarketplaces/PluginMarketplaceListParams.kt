/**
 * List the plugin marketplaces Plugins live in, newest first: the organization's own and its
 * members' personal ones.
 *
 * Plugin marketplaces are created, connected to a repository and deleted in claude.ai, not through
 * this API. The organization's library marketplace, the organization-owned `manual` marketplace
 * that uploads go to when no marketplace is named, is created the first time something is put in it
 * and is listed from then on.
 *
 * **Accepted credentials:** an Admin API key with the `read:plugins` or `read:org_audit` scope, or
 * a Compliance Access Key with the `read:compliance_org_data` scope.
 *
 * Every request must include the beta header `anthropic-beta: ce-plugins-2026-09-01`. A request
 * without it returns `404`, exactly as if the endpoint did not exist. The Plugins API is in beta
 * and is available to Claude Enterprise organizations only. It is not available to Claude Platform
 * (Claude Console) organizations, or to organizations with HIPAA readiness enabled.
